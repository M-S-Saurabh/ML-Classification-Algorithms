Instructions to run the code:

Problem 3:
-----------
To run 1D LDA (Boston-50): 'python LDA1dThres.py'
To run with num_crossval=10: 'python LDA1dThres.py 10'

To run 2D LDA (Digits): 'python LDA2dGaussGM.py'
TO run with num_crossval=10: 'python LDA2dGaussGM.py 10'

Problem 4:
-----------
To run Logistic Regression: 'python logisticRegression.py'
To run Naive Bayes: 'python naiveBayesGaussian.py'

To run both Logistic and Naive Bayes: 'python comparePlots.py'
(Creates comparison plots)
